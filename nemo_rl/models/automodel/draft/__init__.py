"""DSpark block-drafter modules vendored from NVIDIA NeMo Automodel @ 6f423feb0.

The DSpark draft model predicts a whole block of tokens per anchor position in
one parallel pass, cross-attending target-model hidden states. These modules
support online co-training of the draft during RL on the DTensor-v2 backend;
see each file's lineage header for its upstream source and local modifications.
